    Content of the snippet  written using syntax like this:

    "for (let ${index} = 0; ${index} < ${end}; ${index}++) {\n\t${}\n}"

    Each `${}` placeholder (you may also use `#{}`) indicates a field
    that the user can fill in. Its name, if any, will be the default
    content for the field.

    When the snippet is activated by calling the returned function,
    the code is inserted at the given position. Newlines in the
    template are indented by the indentation of the start line, plus
    one [indent unit](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#language.indentUnit) per tab character after
    the newline.

    On activation, (all instances of) the first field are selected.
    The user can move between fields with Tab and Shift-Tab as long as
    the fields are active. Moving to the last field or moving the
    cursor out of the current field deactivates the fields.

    The order of fields defaults to textual order, but you can add
    numbers to placeholders (`${1}` or `${1:defaultText}`) to provide
    a custom order.

    To include a literal `{` or `}` in your template, put a backslash
    in front of it. This will be removed and the brace will not be
    interpreted as indicating a placeholder.
